# Faceless Bytecode - generator

Simple generator for deploying a contract with the given hex string as the bytecode.

## How

The generator does the following:

```
PUSH hex length
PUSH hex offset
PUSH dest offset - 0

CODECOPY - (destOffset, offset, length)

PUSH hex length
PUSH offset - 0

RETURN - (offset, length)
STOP
```

Since smart contracts have a limit of 24 KB we cant use hexadecimal strings with more than 12.000~ characters.
On this case only `PUSH1` and `PUSH2` have been implemented, with `PUSH2` putting a `uint16` onto the stack (more than enough for our character limit).

## Example

```
"Hello World" - 0x48656c6c6f20576f726c64
```

```
./bytecode -i 0x48656c6c6f20576f726c64
======================================
0x600b600d600039600b6000f30048656c6c6f20576f726c64
```

The following generated bytecode:

```
60 0b - PUSH1 11 ("Hello World" length)
60 0d - PUSH1 13 (Offset where the "Hello World" string starts in memory, either 13 or 15 depending on string length)
60 00 - PUSH1 00 (Destination offset where to copy the code)

39 - CODECOPY

60 0b - PUSH1 11 ("Hello World" length)
60 00 - PUSH1 00 (Offset from memory)

f3 - RETURN
00 - STOP

"Hello World" hex string...
```
